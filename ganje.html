      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Overview</h2>
  <p class="text-justify">Ganje uses the user's cellphone as its main UI. While other parcel lockers have a user interface attached to them (like our previous UI version), our parcel lockers are for the future; there is no need for a user interface because we all have one, calling it a smartphone. Users can have Ganje applications on their cell phone or use the web application for all interactions with Ganje. An end user's main interaction with Ganje is picking up parcels from Ganje.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Discovery & Define</h2>
  <p class="text-justify">We used Competitive Analysis to find out what are Other companies user interface, UX and Brand Identity. We used Parcel related Data collection, Interview with subject matter experts and Interview with users to know what are Technical barriers and requirements and gather needed data for Data Analysis, Site Map, and User Flows. This Discovery & Define Process took 5 months and we iterated them after any prototype version.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Big Design Challenge</h2>
  <p class="text-justify">A major challenge in this project was the high cost of the physical lockers, which could deter potential customers. Cost reduction was crucial, but traditional methods didn't offer significant savings. Initially, we used tablets as the machine interface, which was more cost-effective compared to competitors like Amazon and Luxer One. After six months of research and design, I developed the Faceless Locker concept, which not only reduced manufacturing costs but also addressed technical and safety concerns. This innovative idea was unique in the global market and, coincidentally, we launched it just as Amazon and another company introduced similar products.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Deliver</h2>
  <p class="text-justify">To make sure that our ideas worked and to understand any issues in the flows, we constantly prototyped our design with Figma, then tested our UX with user testing, Concierge MVP (designed UI with Human in Blackened), and usability testing. We learned many things about users' needs and mental models about this totally new experience and after 2 years of iterative process we reached an acceptable UX & UI but the design and development is still ongoing.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">User Experience and Interface</h2>
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">How does this web App work?</h3>
  <p class="text-justify">Users can use Ganje via the mobile app or web app to interact with it. Their main interaction is picking up parcels. Businesses request parcel delivery through Ganje's API, booking a cell based on time, duration, parcel size, and locker location. They also register a customer and a courier for each parcel. Authentication data is then sent to both the courier and the customer by the server.</p>
  <p class="text-justify">Once the parcel is delivered to the cell, the server sends a message to notify the receiver that it's ready for pickup. Upon arrival at Ganje, customers are authenticated using a password sent in advance to open their cell and retrieve the parcel. Authentication mostly happens on their mobile phone, which sends data to Ganje's server and the locker's controller via wireless methods like NFC or Bluetooth. If authentication is successful, the locker opens the designated cell.</p>
