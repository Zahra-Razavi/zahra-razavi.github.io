## Files
- `index.html` — your homepage with a grid of projects.
- `projects/mediana-voip.html` —  case study page
- `assets/` — put images here (use webp/jpg; compress for speed).


If you choose a different repo name (e.g., `portfolio`), enable Pages in **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch** and select `main` and `/ (root)`. Your site will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio/`.

## Edit Locally (optional)
- Install **GitHub Desktop** and **VS Code**.
- Clone the repo, edit files, then commit & push.

## Customize
- Replace placeholder text/images.
- Duplicate `projects/mediana-voip.html` for new case studies.
- Keep case studies **mobile-first**: short paragraphs, clear headings, 1-column layout on small screens.
- Tailwind via CDN is included for clean, responsive utility classes.
