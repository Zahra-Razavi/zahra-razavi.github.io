# Portfolio Starter (GitHub Pages)

This folder contains a minimal, responsive portfolio you can deploy to **GitHub Pages** with no build tools.

## Files
- `index.html` — your homepage with a grid of projects.
- `projects/mediana-voip.html` — example case study page to copy for each project.
- `assets/` — put images here (use webp/jpg; compress for speed).

## Quick Deploy (Beginner, Web UI only)
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one).
2. Create a new repository **named exactly**: `<your-username>.github.io` (replace with your GitHub username).
3. Upload all files and folders from this starter into that repo (drag & drop in the web interface).
4. Commit (save) the changes.
5. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`.

If you choose a different repo name (e.g., `portfolio`), enable Pages in **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch** and select `main` and `/ (root)`. Your site will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio/`.

## Edit Locally (optional)
- Install **GitHub Desktop** and **VS Code**.
- Clone the repo, edit files, then commit & push.

## Customize
- Replace placeholder text/images.
- Duplicate `projects/mediana-voip.html` for new case studies.
- Keep case studies **mobile-first**: short paragraphs, clear headings, 1-column layout on small screens.
- Tailwind via CDN is included for clean, responsive utility classes.
